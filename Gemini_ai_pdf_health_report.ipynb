Higher numbers suggest a higher antibody level, potentially indicating a past or present infection.\n",

Typhi \"H\" (1:80) titers in the Widal test suggest a **possible typhoid fever infection**.  The other tests are largely unremarkable, though the elevated ESR (26 mm/hr in the first hour, 52 mm/hr in the second) supports the possibility of an inflammatory process, consistent with typhoid.  Further clinical evaluation and interpretation by the attending physician (Dr. Krishna Prasad) are necessary for a definitive diagnosis.\n",
