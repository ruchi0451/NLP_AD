Honestly, I never made any sense to me. It is two different types of viruses. So not now the flu shot works for all viruses? Concerningly, the latest research shows that getting the flu vaccine increases the risk of getting the coronavirus by 36%!!! Here\\u2019s the first link: \\u201cInfluenza Vaccination and Respiratory Virus Interference Among Department of Defense Personnel During the 2017-2018 Influenza Season. \\u201cFlu Vaccine Increases Coronavirus Risk 36% Says Military Study\\u201d. \\u201cExamining non-influenza viruses specifically, the odds of both coronavirus and human metapneumovirus in vaccinated individuals were significantly higher when compared to unvaccinated individuals (OR = 1.36 and 1.51, respectively) (Table 5).\\u201d Paraphrasing, the study highlights the value of the human body\\u2019s ability to fight against viruses. Apparently, by contracting influenza, the body naturally \\u201cmay reduce the risk of non-influenza respiratory viruses\\u2026\\u201d \\u201cWhile influenza vaccination offers protection against influenza, natural influenza infection may reduce the risk of non-influenza respiratory viruses by providing temporary, non-specific immunity against these viruses. On the other hand, recently published studies have described the phenomenon of vaccine-associated virus interference; that is, vaccinated individuals may be at increased risk for other respiratory viruses because they do not receive the non-specific immunity associated with natural infection.\\u201d Like I blogged about before, the flu shot is known to actually suppress your immune system.\",\n          \"A new report, sent to the White House science adviser, says the country should not rely on warm weather to stop contagion.The homebound and virus-wary across the Northern Hemisphere, from President Trump to cooped-up schoolchildren, have clung to the possibility that the coronavirus pandemic will fade in hot weather, as some viral diseases do.But the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine, in a public report sent to the White House, has said, in effect: Don\\u2019t get your hopes up. After reviewing a variety of research reports, a panel concluded that the studies, of varying quality of evidence, do not offer a basis to believe that summer weather will interfere with the spread of the coronavirus.The pandemic may lessen because of social distancing and other measures, but the evidence so far does not inspire confidence in the benefits of sun and humidity.  The report, sent to Kelvin Droegemeier, director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy at the White House and acting director of the National Science Foundation, was a brief nine-page communication known as a rapid expert consultation.Kristian Andersen, an immunologist at the Scripps Research Translational Institute in California and a member of the Standing Committee on Emerging Infectious Diseases and 21st Century Health Threats at the National Academies, said: \\u201cGiven current data, we believe that the pandemic likely will not diminish because of summer, and we should be careful not to base policies and strategies around the hope that it will.\\u201d\\u201cWe might very well see a reduction in spread in the beginning of the summer,\\u201d he added, \\u201cbut we have to be careful not to put that down to a changing climate \\u2014 it is plausible that such a reduction could be due to other measures put in place.\\u201dHuman behavior will be most important. Dr. David Relman, who studies host-microbe interactions at Stanford, said if a human coughs or sneezes enough virus \\u201cclose enough to the next susceptible person, then temperature and humidity just won\\u2019t matter that much.\\u201dThe report from the National Academies, independent agencies that advise the government and the public, cited a small number of well-controlled laboratory studies that show that high temperature and humidity can diminish the ability of the novel coronavirus to survive in the environment. But the report noted the studies had limitations that made them less than conclusive.It also noted that although some reports showed pandemic growth rates peaking in colder conditions, those studies were short and limited. A preliminary finding in one such study, by scientists at M.I.T., found fewer cases of Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, in warmer climates, but arrived at no definitive conclusion.\\u201cSpecially in the U.S., any effect, even in the summer months, may not be highly visible, so our real chance to stop this virus is indeed through taking quarantine measures,\\u201d said Qasim Bukhari, a computational scientist at M.I.T. who is a co-author of the study.The report sent to the White House also struck a cautionary note: \\u201cGiven that countries currently in \\u2018summer\\u2019 climates, such as Australia and Iran, are experiencing rapid virus spread, a decrease in cases with increases in humidity and temperature elsewhere should not be assumed,\\u201d it said.Pandemics do not behave the same way seasonal outbreaks do. For the National Academies\\u2019 report, researchers looked at the history of flu pandemics as an example. \\u201cThere have been 10 influenza pandemics in the past 250-plus years \\u2014 two started in the Northern Hemisphere winter, three in the spring, two in the summer and three in the fall,\\u201d the report said. \\u201cAll had a peak second wave approximately six months after emergence of the virus in the human population, regardless of when the initial introduction occurred.\\u201dOn March 16, President Trump said the virus might \\u201cwash\\u201d through in warmer weather.\\nDr. Anthony S. Fauci, the nation\\u2019s leading expert on infectious diseases, has expressed different opinions about the effect of summer on the virus, some more optimistic than others. In a live-streamed interview on Wednesday, Dr. Howard Bauchner, the editor in chief of The Journal of the American Medical Association, asked him about the fall, which Dr. Fauci said would be very challenging, after a period this summer when \\u201cit\\u2019s almost certainly going to go down a bit.\\u201d\\nOn March 26, however, in a conversation on Instagram with Stephen Curry of the Golden State Warriors, Dr. Fauci said that although it wasn\\u2019t unreasonable to assume the summer weather could diminish the spread, \\u201cyou don\\u2019t want to count on it.\\u201d\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"source\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 269,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"www.who.int\",\n          \"https://www.tierneyrealnewsnetwork.com/\",\n          \"https://www.forbes.com/\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Fake\",\n          \"TRUE\",\n          \"fake\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

The virus causing it is very potent and is resistant to existing antibiotics. (virus is not bacterial infection hence cannot be treated by antibiotics). The prevention method now is to keep your throat moist, do not let your throat dry up. Thus do not hold your thirst because once your membrane in your throat is dried, the virus will invade into your body within 10 mins. Drink 50-80cc warm water, 30-50cc for kids, according to age. Everytime [sic] you feel your throat is dry, do not wait, keep water in hand. Do not drink plenty at one time as it does not help; instead, continue to keep throat moist. Till end of March, do not go to crowded places, wear mask as needed especially in train or public transportation. Avoid fried or spicy food and load up vitamin C. The symptoms/description are: Repeated high fever. 2. Prolonged coughing after fever. 3. Children are more prone. 4. Adults usually feel uneasy, headache and mainly respiratory related illness.

It\\u2019s even eclipsing President Trump\\u2019s impeachment proceedings in the Senate, with news about entire cities in China that are home to tens of millions of people being put under mandatory quarantine.We\\u2019re also seeing headlines about coronavirus popping up in major U.S. cities like Seattle, Houston and Chicago, which is starting to generate panic here in our own country about how far this thing will go before either fizzling out \\u2013 a best-case scenario \\u2013 or spreading like wildfire.As Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, is now warning, the rapid adaptation or mutation of coronavirus suggests that this might be another weaponized viral strain that was intentionally unleashed for eugenics purposes.Mainstream reporting is admitting that coronavirus is constantly changing like some kind of self-replicating bioweapon, which is all too convenient considering that the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation-funded Pirbright Institute owns a patent on coronavirus for vaccine creation purposes.Was this whole outbreak engineered for the purpose of scaring the general public into accepting yet another government vaccine? Is it also about depopulating the planet as part of Bill Gates\\u2019 admitted efforts to use vaccination and \\u201chealth care\\u201d as a means of reducing the world\\u2019s population by 10 to 15 percent?Time will tell what becomes of this latest public health scare, but one thing is for sure: Bill Gates and his eugenicist buddies are chomping at the bit to vaccinate the entire planet against coronavirus and any other disease they can conjure up as a deadly bioweapon.At the current time, the fatality rate associated with coronavirus infection is relatively low, around two percent. But that could very quickly change as the virus mutates and adapts to new environments, creating the horrific scenario predicted by Event 201.\\u201cExperts agree that it is only a matter of time before one of these epidemics becomes global \\u2013 a pandemic with potentially catastrophic consequences,\\u201d the Event 201 description ominously forebodes.\\u201cA severe pandemic, which becomes \\u2018Event 201,\\u2019 would require reliable cooperation among several industries, national governments, and key international institutions.\\u201dTo keep up with the latest news about coronavirus, be sure to check out Outbreak.news.You can also learn more about how many of these contagion scares are pre-planned, engineered false flag events at FalseFlag.news.\",\n          \"Two documents reprinted on, each argue that there are reasons to think that 5G radiation is greatly stimulating the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and therefore, an important public health measure would be to shut down the 5G antennae and particularly the small cell 5G antennae in close proximity to our homes, schools, businesses, house of worship and hospitals. The first of these documents [1] published by Miller et al., concerns the impact of 5G radiation on the immune system of the body and also suggests that 5G radiation may also increase the replication of the virus. In both of these ways, 5G radiation may be expected to make the COVID-19 pandemic much worse. The second of these documents [1] is my own and is derived from a larger document on 5G radiation effects [2]. It starts with the history of 5G in Wuhan, China, the epicenter of the COVID-19 epidemic. Wuhan is China\\u2019s first 5G \\u201csmart city\\u201d and is the location of China\\u2019s first 5G highway where 5G radiation is being used to test self-driving vehicles. Approximately 10,000 5G antennae were installed and activated in Wuhan in 2019, with approximately 75 to 80% of these installed and activated in the last 2 \\u00bd months of the year. The epidemic was first detected near the beginning of that 2 \\u00bd month period and became vastly more severe, with extremely large increases in numbers of cases and in deaths by the end of 2019. That may, of course be coincidental. The death rate in other parts of China from COVID-19 infections has been substantially lower than that in Wuhan with its unparalleled high numbers of 5G antennae (Xu et al., BMJ 2020; 368:m606) \\u2013 that of course could also be coincidental. South Korea, which became the site of the worst epidemic outside of China, has large numbers of 5G antennae all over the country. The Milan area of Italy, currently, the worst epicenter in Europe also is a 5G center. And Seattle area, which was the worst area in the U.S. is also a major 5G area. New York City has become the largest epicenter in the US is another 5G site. These non-Chinese epidemic areas are not discussed in my paper, but these findings are accurate. Again, the locations of these epicenters in 5G areas may be coincidental.These figures add to the argument that 5G radiation may have a substantial role in exacerbating the COVID-19 pandemic \\u2013 they are not definitive however and we must look to the mechanism of action of EMFs and the evidence that other EMFs produce similar, if less severe effects which are similar to but less severe than what we are apparently seeing following 5G exposure. Electromagnetic fields, including the highly pulsed and therefore highly dangerous 5G millimeter wave radiation, act via activation of voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) with VGCC activation producing five different effects, each of which have roles in stimulating the replication and spread of coronaviruses. Excessive intracellular calcium. Oxidative stress. NF-kappaB elevation. Inflammation. Apoptosis (programmed cell death) The predominant cause of death in the COVID-19 epidemic, is pneumonia and each of these five effects also have roles in pneumonia, such that each of them is predicted to greatly increase the percent of people dying in this epidemic. It seems highly plausible that 5G radiation is greatly increasing the spread of the epidemic and also the death rate in individuals that are infected. You may wish to consider all of this in conjunction with the broader findings with regard to the dangers of 5G and other effects apparently produced by 5G exposures. How then did we get to this state? Many independent scientists, including myself, have argued that there should be no 5G rollout until there is extensive biological safety testing of genuine 5G radiation with all of its dangerous modulating pulses. However the industry has refused to get independent 5G testing and the FCC and other regulatory agencies have refused to require such testing. Furthermore, the EMF \\u201csafety guidelines\\u201d which are supposed to protect us from health impacts of EMF radiation have been shown, based on eight different types of highly repeated studies, to fail massively to predict biological effects. They therefore fail to predict safety [3]. It follows from this that all assurances of safety based on these \\u201csafety guidelines\\u201d are fraudulent. Consequently, there is no evidence whatsoever of 5G safety and much evidence of lack of safety. It is my opinion, therefore, that 5G radiation is greatly stimulating the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and also the major cause of death, pneumonia and therefore, an important public health measure would be to shut down the 5G antennae, particularly the small cell 5G antennae in close proximity to our homes, schools, businesses, houses of worship and hospitals.

If it succeeds, it can produce an infection \\u2014 in this case, a respiratory disease. The type of cells a virus targets and how it enters them depend on how the virus is built.This virus gets its family name from a telltale series of spikes \\u2014 tens or even hundreds of them \\u2014 that circle its bloblike core like a crown, or corona. Virologists know from studying its close cousins, viruses that cause SARS and MERS, that the spikes interact with receptors on cells like keys in locks, enabling the virus to enter.Very recent innovations in imaging techniques enabled researchers to peer so closely at the novel virus\\u2019s spikes that they created a model of one, right down to the atoms, and are beginning to reveal its secrets.It has a clever disguise.Sugars dot the outside of the spike, just like sugars dot the outside of regular human cells, said David Veesler, a structural virologist at the University of Washington who led a team that visualized the SARS-CoV-2 spike and published a March 19 paper on its architecture.This carbohydrate camouflage makes the virus more difficult for the human immune system to recognize.t seems to attach by opening and closing.Each spike is made of three identical proteins twisted together, Veesler said.His team captured images of the ends of these proteins opening in the spike\\u2019s cap-like apex before and during the attempt to bind to a receptor. Studies on SARS- and MERS-causing viruses indicate that all three proteins in a spike have to open for it to gain access to a cell.Experts say a vaccine is at least a year away, but they\\u2019re coming up with strategies now.One may be able to trigger antibodies that strike areas of the protein that are exposed when it opens, said virologist Vineet Menachery, who specializes in the study of coronaviruses at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston.The holy grail of vaccines, Veesler said, would trigger antibodies that attack a spike\\u2019s stem, which is so similar to other coronaviruses that a single vaccine might protect against several strains instead of just one.One treatment avenue may be to block receptors so the spikes have nowhere to attach.Perhaps a concert of strategies could work together against these tiny invaders, each 1,000 times smaller than the cells they infect. After all, the natural human immune response plays defense in many ways at once.While we wait for a vaccine, we have ways to defeat it.Soap \\u2014 bar soap, liquid soap, laundry detergent and such \\u2014 is virus kryptonite, which is why the message \\u201cWash your hands!\\u201d is everywhere. But Menachery said heat and ultraviolet light are two other ways to neutralize a coronavirus, and each of these methods works in a different way.After about 20 seconds of contact, soap breaks apart the fragile, fatty membrane that holds the virus together. Disinfecting agents with at least 60 percent alcohol puncture and destroy the virus in a similar way.Extreme heat \\u2014 near boiling \\u2014 causes the proteins in the spikes to unravel and lose their shape, deactivating them.

When a harmful invader \\u2014 like a cold or flu virus, or the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 \\u2014 gets into your body, your immune system mounts an attack. Known as an immune response, this attack is a sequence of events that involves various cells and unfolds over time.\\nFollowing general health guidelines is the best step you can take toward keeping your immune system strong and healthy. Every part of your body, including your immune system, functions better when protected from environmental assaults and bolstered by healthy-living strategies such as these:Don't smoke or vape.Eat a diet high in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.Take a multivitamin if you suspect that you may not be getting all the nutrients you need through your diet.\\nExercise regularly.Maintain a healthy weight.Control your stress level.Control your blood pressure.If you drink alcohol, drink only in moderation (no more than one to two drinks a day for men, no more than one a day for women).Get enough sleep.Take steps to avoid infection, such as washing your hands frequently and trying not to touch your hands to your face, since harmful germs can enter through your eyes, nose, and mouth.\",\n          \"How to Clean Your Phone to Help Protect Against CoronavirusIt\\u2019s one thing to stop touching your face. It\\u2019s another to stop touching the things that touch your face.The coronavirus is here, and it\\u2019s showing no signs of letting up. One of the best ways to protect yourself is to keep your hands clean and off your face, but it\\u2019s hard to maintain constant vigilance.Keeping your phone sanitized is another smart way to keep germs off your fingertips. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention considers your phone a \\u201chigh-touch surface,\\u201d which could make it a carrier of the virus.But cleaning your phone \\u2014 thoroughly, I mean \\u2014 is not as straightforward as it might seem. There are all sorts of nooks and crannies, delicate glass and intricate protective cases.The Don\\u2019ts Any sort of moisture can interfere with your phone\\u2019s function. Apple recommends that people avoid using spray cleaners or heavy-duty products.No bleach, no aerosol sprays. You need your phone to work, even if you want it clean.Also \\u2014 and this probably goes without saying \\u2014 don\\u2019t dunk your phone into any sort of liquid, anti-bacterial or otherwise. It won\\u2019t end well for either of you.The Dos, A gentle wipe with a product that has 70 percent isopropyl alcohol will do just fine. Apple recommends Clorox Disinfecting Wipes, and the C.D.C. says household disinfectants registered by the Environmental Protection Agency are effective.Wear disposable gloves to clean, the C.D.C. recommends, and wash your hands thoroughly after you\\u2019re done. Like your phone, reusable gloves might harbor virus particles, rendering them effectively useless.And don\\u2019t forget your phone case.Wipe it down, in and out, through and through. Let it dry before reassembling it.You might also consider changing a bit of your behavior. AT&T suggests sharing photos through texts, instead of passing the phone around, and using devices like headphones and technology like Bluetooth to keep your phone away from your face.Why?This might be the best thing you can do all day. This outbreak is fast-moving and research is, by nature, slow to catch up. As a result, the C.D.C. does not yet know exactly how long the virus can cling to a surface, but evidence suggests it could be \\u201chours to days.\\u201dAnd phones are, well, gross. A 2017 study published in the journal Germs found a host of bacteria, viruses and pathogens on 27 phones owned by teenagers. The scientists wrote that they \\u201chypothesize that this may play a role in the spread of infectious agents in the community.\\u201dSafe is always better than sorry.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

              "'Will holding your breath for 10 seconds reveal if you have coronavirus?University of Maryland Chief Quality Officer and Chief of Infectious Diseases Dr. Faheem Younus tweeted on March 16: “Wrong: Most young patients with coronavirus will be able to hold their breaths for much longer than 10 seconds. And many elderly without the virus won’t be able to do it.”On March 17, Dr. Thomas Nash, a New York Presbyterian Hospital internist, pulmonologist and infectious disease specialist, told Reuters the breath test was “just made up.”\\nDifferent posts mistakenly source the claim to an unnamed Stanford Hospital Board member, a Japanese doctor or Taiwanese experts. On March 13, Stanford University tweeted, “Misinformation about COVID-19 symptoms and treatment falsely attributed to Stanford is circulating on social media and in email forwards. It is not from Stanford.”Stanford Health Care spokeswoman Lisa Kim told CNN on March 17 that the \"dangerous\" claim was not from Stanford Medicine and \"contains inaccurate information.\"The March 13 post claimed the breath test checked for fibrosis caused by COVID-19. The post read, “By the time they have fever and/or cough and go to the hospital, the lung is usually 50% Fibrosis and it\\'s too late.”Fibrosis is defined as “the overgrowth, hardening, and/or scarring of various tissues” caused by “chronic inflammatory reactions induced by a variety of stimuli including persistent infections, autoimmune reactions, allergic responses, chemical insults, radiation, and tissue injury.”Dr. Robert Legare Atmar, an infectious disease specialist at Baylor College of Medicine called the post’s language \"extremely alarmist\" to CNN on March 17.Nash told Reuters that “fibrosis takes months if not years to develop.”Although COVID-19 can lead to pneumonia in some patients, which can eventually lead to fibrosis, Nash said this virus “is brand new and no one on the planet knows if it causes fibrosis.”’The post also claimed  the development of pneumonia was the second symptom of COVID-19, but according to the World Health Organization only patients with severe cases develop pneumonia.Along with fibrosis and pneumonia, the post misrepresents COVID-19 symptoms as feeling “like you’re drowning.”Atmar said COVID-19 patients likely wouldn’t experience that symptom, “That does not sound like any other respiratory virus people are infected with and many patients with coronavirus have not had nasal infection at all.\"In addition to the breath test, Facebook posts suggest ineffective methods to protect against the virus such as drinking large amounts of water, gargling saltwater and exposure to heat and sun.A similar March 12 Facebook post with nearly 200 shares read, “Even if the virus gets into your mouth, drinking water and other fluids will help wash it down ... the hydrochloric acid in your stomach will kill the germs. If you do not drink enough water regularly, the virus can enter the airways and into your lungs”.\\nYounas debunked the water method on Twitter, “Virus may gain entry via throat but it penetrates into the host cells. You can’t wash it away. Excessive water will make you run to the toilet.”PolitFact and Snopes both discredited the claim that “you should also gargle as a prevention” method. Both found that while gargling does ease throat discomfort there is no evidence that it kills the virus.The March 13 Facebook post also claimed that COVID-19 “hates the sun” and could be killed by just “26/27 degrees,” which is about 78 degrees Fahrenheit. PolitiFact debunked the claim that sun exposure kills the virus. The WHO warns that hot baths and warm climates do not prevent the spread of COVID-19.'"
