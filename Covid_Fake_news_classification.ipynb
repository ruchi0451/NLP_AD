Honestly, I never made any sense to me. It is two different types of viruses. So not now the flu shot works for all viruses? Concerningly, the latest research shows that getting the flu vaccine increases the risk of getting the coronavirus by 36%!!! Here\\u2019s the first link: \\u201cInfluenza Vaccination and Respiratory Virus Interference Among Department of Defense Personnel During the 2017-2018 Influenza Season. \\u201cFlu Vaccine Increases Coronavirus Risk 36% Says Military Study\\u201d. \\u201cExamining non-influenza viruses specifically, the odds of both coronavirus and human metapneumovirus in vaccinated individuals were significantly higher when compared to unvaccinated individuals (OR = 1.36 and 1.51, respectively) (Table 5).\\u201d Paraphrasing, the study highlights the value of the human body\\u2019s ability to fight against viruses. Apparently, by contracting influenza, the body naturally \\u201cmay reduce the risk of non-influenza respiratory viruses\\u2026\\u201d \\u201cWhile influenza vaccination offers protection against influenza, natural influenza infection may reduce the risk of non-influenza respiratory viruses by providing temporary, non-specific immunity against these viruses. On the other hand, recently published studies have described the phenomenon of vaccine-associated virus interference; that is, vaccinated individuals may be at increased risk for other respiratory viruses because they do not receive the non-specific immunity associated with natural infection.\\u201d Like I blogged about before, the flu shot is known to actually suppress your immune system.\",\n          \"A new report, sent to the White House science adviser, says the country should not rely on warm weather to stop contagion.The homebound and virus-wary across the Northern Hemisphere, from President Trump to cooped-up schoolchildren, have clung to the possibility that the coronavirus pandemic will fade in hot weather, as some viral diseases do.But the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine, in a public report sent to the White House, has said, in effect: Don\\u2019t get your hopes up. After reviewing a variety of research reports, a panel concluded that the studies, of varying quality of evidence, do not offer a basis to believe that summer weather will interfere with the spread of the coronavirus.The pandemic may lessen because of social distancing and other measures, but the evidence so far does not inspire confidence in the benefits of sun and humidity.  The report, sent to Kelvin Droegemeier, director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy at the White House and acting director of the National Science Foundation, was a brief nine-page communication known as a rapid expert consultation.Kristian Andersen, an immunologist at the Scripps Research Translational Institute in California and a member of the Standing Committee on Emerging Infectious Diseases and 21st Century Health Threats at the National Academies, said: \\u201cGiven current data, we believe that the pandemic likely will not diminish because of summer, and we should be careful not to base policies and strategies around the hope that it will.\\u201d\\u201cWe might very well see a reduction in spread in the beginning of the summer,\\u201d he added, \\u201cbut we have to be careful not to put that down to a changing climate \\u2014 it is plausible that such a reduction could be due to other measures put in place.\\u201dHuman behavior will be most important. Dr. David Relman, who studies host-microbe interactions at Stanford, said if a human coughs or sneezes enough virus \\u201cclose enough to the next susceptible person, then temperature and humidity just won\\u2019t matter that much.\\u201dThe report from the National Academies, independent agencies that advise the government and the public, cited a small number of well-controlled laboratory studies that show that high temperature and humidity can diminish the ability of the novel coronavirus to survive in the environment. But the report noted the studies had limitations that made them less than conclusive.It also noted that although some reports showed pandemic growth rates peaking in colder conditions, those studies were short and limited. A preliminary finding in one such study, by scientists at M.I.T., found fewer cases of Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, in warmer climates, but arrived at no definitive conclusion.\\u201cSpecially in the U.S., any effect, even in the summer months, may not be highly visible, so our real chance to stop this virus is indeed through taking quarantine measures,\\u201d said Qasim Bukhari, a computational scientist at M.I.T. who is a co-author of the study.The report sent to the White House also struck a cautionary note: \\u201cGiven that countries currently in \\u2018summer\\u2019 climates, such as Australia and Iran, are experiencing rapid virus spread, a decrease in cases with increases in humidity and temperature elsewhere should not be assumed,\\u201d it said.Pandemics do not behave the same way seasonal outbreaks do. For the National Academies\\u2019 report, researchers looked at the history of flu pandemics as an example. \\u201cThere have been 10 influenza pandemics in the past 250-plus years \\u2014 two started in the Northern Hemisphere winter, three in the spring, two in the summer and three in the fall,\\u201d the report said. \\u201cAll had a peak second wave approximately six months after emergence of the virus in the human population, regardless of when the initial introduction occurred.\\u201dOn March 16, President Trump said the virus might \\u201cwash\\u201d through in warmer weather.\\nDr. Anthony S. Fauci, the nation\\u2019s leading expert on infectious diseases, has expressed different opinions about the effect of summer on the virus, some more optimistic than others. In a live-streamed interview on Wednesday, Dr. Howard Bauchner, the editor in chief of The Journal of the American Medical Association, asked him about the fall, which Dr. Fauci said would be very challenging, after a period this summer when \\u201cit\\u2019s almost certainly going to go down a bit.\\u201d\\nOn March 26, however, in a conversation on Instagram with Stephen Curry of the Golden State Warriors, Dr. Fauci said that although it wasn\\u2019t unreasonable to assume the summer weather could diminish the spread, \\u201cyou don\\u2019t want to count on it.\\u201d\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"source\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 269,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"www.who.int\",\n          \"https://www.tierneyrealnewsnetwork.com/\",\n          \"https://www.forbes.com/\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Fake\",\n          \"TRUE\",\n          \"fake\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
