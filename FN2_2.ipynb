It goes hand in hand with another important distinction, between \\u2018wants\\u2019 and \\u2018needs.\\u2019 Together these two pairs of distinctions go a long way towards explaining why the West is losing ground to the East, in a momentous shift that will underpin the big bull market in gold that lies ahead\\u2026 IMPORTANT: To find out which high-grade silver mining company billionaire Eric Sprott just purchased a nearly 20% stake in and learn why he believes this is one of the most exciting silver stories in the world \\u2013 CLICK HERE OR BELOW: Sponsored \\nToday, as it has been doing for decades, the West is focused on money and on wants. The East is focused on wealth and on needs. And that gives the East a big leg up in the contest to gain control of the world\\u2019s future. Is there any possibility the West can still revamp its priorities and steer a better course? As I note below, I think there is, but it\\u2019s getting very late in the game. \\nLet\\u2019s look at what these somewhat abstract concepts mean in concrete terms, starting with the military arena. If a major power could provide its military with everything it wants , it would likely seek to have a force that spans the globe, that can defend against all threats, and that if necessary can quell or conquer any prospective enemy \\u2014 i.e., it would be cast very much in the mold of the U.S. military. These goals are a lot more expansive \\u2013 and expensive \\u2013 than a nation\\u2019s basic military needs, which come down to protection and security. \\nChina is focused on these basic military needs and isn\\u2019t getting distracted by more grandiose \\u2018wants.\\u2019 From cyber security to land, sea, and air protection, China is clearly putting needs ahead of wants. \\nThe Game-Changer: China\\u2019s J-20 Recently, for example, China showed off its newest stealth plane, the J-20, whose range is somewhat limited but whose maneuverability within its range is extraordinary. China\\u2019s (and Russia\\u2019s) land-based hypersonic missiles, while also having a limited range, have the ability to take down an aircraft carrier that ventures into waters they claim for their own. \\nSimilarly in the realm of underwater protection, China earlier this year showcased its new stealth submarine. While its exact specs remain secret, it\\u2019s clear from the design that the new underwater vessel is a quantum jump from earlier models. It\\u2019s undetectable and capable of firing vertical missiles at any unwanted intruder. \\nThe point is that while by many measures the West\\u2019s military is mightier, the East has a military better designed to meet a country\\u2019s basic needs in today\\u2019s world \\u2013 especially when you include cyber security, which too often is still viewed as just a footnote to a nation\\u2019s military arsenal. The cyber area is one place where it is very difficult to have a defense. A powerful defense is also a monster offense. Just the fact that Eastern (Chinese and Russian) control of cyber space could upset the most vital liberty in the West, the right to a fair election, is a clarion call that the West has not met its basic needs in dealing with security threats. This is particularly shameful given that a mere decade ago we had what seemed like a nearly insurmountable lead in vital technologies such as super computers. \\nThis brings me to the second distinction, between wealth and money. The West outspends the East by more than two to one on its military. But the West\\u2019s lack of focus on real wealth, ranging from vital commodities to information technologies, is a massive Achilles heel. In addition to cyber, the Army\\u2019s chief futurist, Lt. General H.R. McMaster, has said that within the next decade Russia will have surpassed the U.S. in three of 10 critical military areas, will equal us in six, and will lag in only one. And that\\u2019s just Russia; it doesn\\u2019t take China\\u2019s role into account. The point: all our money can\\u2019t buy us military dominance unless we make sure we fully satisfy critical needs. \\nThe East Moving To Have Monetary System Anchored By Gold The East\\u2019s military position is important beyond providing it security against physical and virtual threats. America\\u2019s preeminence in every sphere has long been based on our military dominance. It\\u2019s why the dollar has been so sought after. Once our military dominance is in doubt, it will hasten the move from a dollar-based monetary system to one anchored by gold, which is the East\\u2019s goal. Prices Of Base Metals (London Metals Exchange) \\nOn the economic issues, you only need to look at the attached chart to know that in this area, too, China is doing something right. The chart presents six base commodities \\u2013 zinc, copper, aluminum, lead, tin, and nickel \\u2013 and shows that from their lows in mid-January, they have climbed nearly 25 percent. Clearly these gains come not on the back of the anemic West but must be credited to the much peppier conditions in the East. \\nAdmittedly some of these gains may come from stockpiling. Indeed, Chinese stockpiling is across the board with oil imports setting records and even iron ore imports at historically high levels. Such commodities constitute real wealth, as opposed to mere money, and China\\u2019s accumulation of them is certainly part of the reason China will export about $1 trillion to the Silk Road this year. \\nAs Bloomberg reported recently, Ratna Sahay, acting director of the IMF\\u2019s Monetary and Capital Markets Department, visited various Chinese banks, which the West widely believes will be at the heart of a coming seismic shock to the world\\u2019s economies. Ms. Sahay\\u2019s conclusion: \\u201cThe fundamental issues that they need to tackle are the loss-making corporates and excess capacity. When you solve that issue, the other problems will start diminishing.\\u201d \\nThe rise in base commodities traced in the chart is also powerful evidence that the issue of excess capacity is being addressed big time. That the government continues to rid the red-inked state-owned enterprises (SOE\\u2019s) of corruption, force the worst of them into bankruptcy, and require others to merge, is compelling evidence that China is doing exactly what it needs to do. \\nThe Price Of The Monetary Anchor (Gold) To Skyrocket China is clearly preparing to dominate this century by maintaining a laser-like focus on needs and wealth. And to risk sounding like a broken record, one of the most sought-after sources of wealth is gold along with other precious metals. These will be at the heart of the monetary system, maybe at first in the East but eventually, worldwide. Regardless, as the East develops, the price of the monetary anchor (gold) will skyrocket. Dreams of five-digit gold and three-digit silver are coming ever closer to reality. \\nFinally, I don\\u2019t think it\\u2019s too late for the West, but it won\\u2019t be easy. For anyone curious about what really separates East from West, I\\u2019d recommend reading the work of the redoubtable Richard Nisbett, now an emeritus chaired professor at the University of Michigan. He points to critical learned differences in thinking between East and West. I firmly believe that for the two centuries ended in the early 1970s, the West combined the best of these different modes of thinking. And this means we are not doomed. It\\u2019s not a question of genetic wiring. We just need to fervently hope that whoever is elected President on Tuesday is up to the task of getting us back to the mindset that had made us perhaps the greatest nation that ever was.\\u201d ***KWN has now released the extraordinary audio interview with Egon von Greyerz, where he gives KWN listeners a look what is really happening behind the scenes globally and in the gold market, and you can listen to it by CLICKING HERE OR ON THE IMAGE BELOW. \\n***ALSO RELEASED: The Destiny Of The World CLICK HERE. \\n\\u00a9 2015 by King World News\\u00ae.

About author\",\n          \"The   at the Democratic National Committee after an embarrassing breach of its email system continued on Tuesday with the departure of three senior officials. Amy Dacey, the committee\\u2019s chief executive Luis Miranda, its communications director and Brad Marshall, its chief financial officer, will leave amid a reshuffling of leadership positions, said Donna Brazile, the interim chairwoman. The departures came more than a week after WikiLeaks posted almost 20, 000 of the committee\\u2019s emails, a number of which revealed officials showing favoritism toward Hillary Clinton in her primary campaign against Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. The messages confirmed the concerns expressed by Mr. Sanders throughout the campaign, cast a cloud over the start of the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia last week and led to the resignation of Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida as the committee\\u2019s chairwoman. Ms. Brazile praised the outgoing staff members and made no mention of the controversy. \\u201cThanks in part to the hard work of Amy, Luis, and Brad, the Democratic Party has adopted the most progressive platform in history, has put itself in financial position to win in November, and has begun the important work of investing in state party partnerships,\\u201d she said in a statement. \\u201cI\\u2019m so grateful for their commitment to this cause, and I wish them continued success in the next chapter of their career. \\u201d American intelligence officials believe that the Russian government was behind the breach of the committee\\u2019s emails and documents, possibly as part of an effort to damage Mrs. Clinton and sow discord in the Democratic Party. An email from Mr. Marshall to Mark Paustenbach, a communications official, and Ms. Dacey suggesting that the committee promote questions about Mr. Sanders\\u2019s faith drew particular scorn from the senator and his supporters. \\u201cIt might may no difference, but for KY and WVA can we get someone to ask his belief. Does he believe in a God,\\u201d Mr. Marshall wrote, referring to Kentucky and West Virginia. \\u201cHe had skated on saying he has a Jewish heritage. I think I read he is an atheist. This could make several points difference with my peeps. \\u201d In May, Mr. Paustenbach wrote to Mr. Miranda about encouraging reporters to write that Mr. Sanders\\u2019s campaign was \\u201ca mess\\u201d after a glitch on the committee\\u2019s servers gave the Sanders campaign access to the Clinton campaign\\u2019s voter database. \\u201cWondering if there\\u2019s a good Bernie narrative for a story, which is that Bernie never ever had his act together, that his campaign was a mess,\\u201d Mr. Paustenbach wrote. Mr. Miranda wrote back: \\u201cTrue, but the Chair has been advised to not engage. So we\\u2019ll have to leave it alone. \\u201d The committee has since apologized to the Sanders campaign. To help fill the void, the committee announced, it is bringing on Tom McMahon, a former executive director of the committee, to lead a transition team.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0,\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

[Authorities charged the    Kaine with \\u201cfleeing police on foot, concealing his identity in a public place, and obstructing legal process,\\u201d according to a detailed Twin Cities Pioneer Press report. \\u201cWhen people seek to prevent others who are peacefully assembled from making their voices heard, it threatens the very foundation of our democracy,\\u201d a local attorney said Friday after the charges against Kaine and seven others were announced.  Police said Kaine was allegedly part of a violent, masked group: Security officers saw five people dressed in black leaving the Capitol, including one who threw a smoke bomb inside, according to complaints filed by the city attorney\\u2019s office. They went to a nearby spot and \\u201ctried to change their appearance by doing things like taking off their black clothing, putting on different jackets or hats, and turning their clothing inside out,\\u201d the complaints said. When police approached, they scattered and ran. Steve Frazer, who was then a St. Paul police senior commander, chased a man who was later identified as Woody Kaine. A Mar. 7 Twin Cities Pioneer Press report states that Kaine allegedly fought with police after being part of a group that threw a smoke bomb in a government building during a rally for President Trump: Clad in black and wearing a mask, the youngest son of Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine wrested himself from the cop and then \\u201csquared off\\u201d with him. Woody Kaine, 24, was among five masked,   people suspected of lobbing a smoke bomb minutes earlier inside the Minnesota Capitol rotunda Saturday afternoon. Officers had chased him down, but Kaine wasn\\u2019t about to submit, according to a more detailed account provided Wednesday by St. Paul police. In the end, it took three officers, a \\u201cknee strike\\u201d and a chemical spray to subdue Kaine after he was identified as one of the counterprotesters [sic] who allegedly used fireworks or a smoke bomb to disrupt a rally in support of President Donald Trump at the Minnesota State Capitol, according to police spokesman Steve Linders. Less than two months before his son was arrested after the   and   speech riot, Kaine said on MSNBC that progressives must \\u201cfight in the streets\\u201d after Trump\\u2019s election. \\u201cWhat we\\u2019ve got to do is fight in Congress, fight in the courts, fight in the streets, fight online, fight at the ballot box, and now there\\u2019s the momentum to be able to do this,\\u201d Kaine told MSNBC\\u2019s Mika Brzezinski on Jan. 31. After his son\\u2019s arrest, Kaine issued a statement that did not appear to condemn his son\\u2019s alleged actions. \\u201cWe love that our three children have their own views and concerns about current political issues. They fully understand the responsibility to express those concerns peacefully,\\u201d Kaine said, as reported by Breitbart News. On Friday, a Kaine spokeswoman doubled down, ignoring allegations that Kaine had taken part in   the Minnesota State Capitol and attempting to dismiss the severity of fighting police officers. \\u201cToday\\u2019s announcement of misdemeanor charges against Sen. Kaine\\u2019s son contains no suggestion that he engaged in disruptive behavior while at the rally, but are instead focused on his actions as he was arrested after he left. Tim and Anne support their son and hope the matter is resolved soon,\\u201d she said to the Twin Cities Pioneer Press. Kaine was charged the same day the New York Post revealed that police arrested a prominent Democratic leader, Jacob Schwartz, with ties to Hillary Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook, for child pornography charges, for allegedly having thousands of photos and videos of showing \\u201cyoung nude females between the approximate ages of 6 months and 16, engaging in sexual conduct  \\u2026     on an adult male\\u201d on his laptop.\",\n          \"Daniel Greenfield FBI Releases Files on Bill Clinton's Cash for Pardons Scandal FBI Releases Files on Bill Clinton's Cash for Pardons Scandal November 1, 2016 Daniel Greenfield \\nThe FBI has an early present for Hillary Clinton. It's the files from the time her husband decided to pardon a wanted fugitive in exchange for cash. That fugitive was a fellow by the name of Marc Rich. His prosecutor? James Comey. \\nThe FBI unexpectedly released 129 pages of documents related to an investigation closed without charges in 2005 into President Bill Clinton\\u2019s pardon of Marc Rich, who had been married to a wealthy Democratic donor. \\nThe unusual timing of the release was the result of a Freedom of Information Act request that had been completed and was posted under standard FBI practice, according to a law enforcement official who asked not to be identified discussing internal matters. But the Clinton campaign immediately questioned the timing of the release. \\nWell of course it did. It's never especially wise to pick fights with people who have a lot of dirt on you. \\nThe investigation stemmed from one of several pardons Clinton made on the last day of his presidency in 2001, that of financier and international fugitive Marc Rich, whose ex-wife Denise had given to the Democratic National Committee and the entity that would later become the Clinton Foundation. \\nAnd there's a surprise guest. \\nWhile the files may seem dated, they invoke figures beyond the Clintons who went on to play key roles in official Washington -- including Comey. \\nHe served as prosecutor in charge of a legal case against Rich from 1987 to 1993. As the U.S. attorney in Manhattan in 2002, Comey took over a criminal investigation of Clinton\\u2019s pardons. \\u201cI was stunned\\u201d at the Rich pardon, Comey wrote in a letter to lawmakers in 2008. \\nClinton's people are fuming, but it was a standard FIOA request and there's nothing big here. It's just one of those things the Clintons should have gone to jail for. But didn't.
